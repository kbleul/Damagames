=== Interface Configuration

== Starting and Stopping Operation

=== Initial Start of Operation

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../.github/workflows/docker_deploy.yml[docker_deploy.yml workflow definition]
----

=== Regular Startup Und Shutdown

Regular startup should be done via GitHub workflows.

Shutdown can be done via docker stop commands.

example
[source%linenums,shell]
----
docker ps -a
docker stop dama_php_1
docker stop dama_redis_1
docker stop dama_nginx-frontend_1
docker stop dama_database_1
docker stop traefik
docker stop damagames_api_1
docker stop damagames_socket_1
docker stop damagames_frontend_1
