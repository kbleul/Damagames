== Introduction and Goals

DAMA is a multiplayer platform for playing checkers online against friends or other unknown players.
For a VAS subscription of daily 2 Birr you get daily 100 coins which allows on average for 10 games. Game cost can depend on skill of player, there are different levels of cost and potential winnings per game.

You can get additional coins by 

- one-off payment
- winning against other players
- inviting friends

Possibly there will be an integration with eCommerce site(s) to "cash out" by getting products (for example buy shampoo with 10,000 coins)

The business goal is to maximize profits.

=== Requirements Overview


Main driving force for the game is to acquire as many players as possible and have them play as many games as possible to create revenue. For this gamification and audiovisual feedback is used to reward players.

Backlog is managed at https://jaktech.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DAMA/boards/3/backlog

The game should enable users to easily

- sign up or sign in
- subscribe and unsubscribe to daily credits
- check their current credits
- start a game of checkers with friends or strangers currently online
- get a reward when they win
- invite friends to a game (possibly for reward of credit when inviting a new player)

Should have gamification
- get a reward for daily log in
- see their rank (i.e. ELO based "you are ranked No. 234 of 22422 players" or military tiers that fit with the theme of the game "King", "General", ...)

KPIs

- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- # completed games daily
- # completed games monthly
- responsiveness: ms until user move is updated on clients
- Avg. wait time for starting a new game
- % of game requests where game was cancelled after waiting > 3 seconds
- % of game requests where wait time was > 20 seconds

| Payments through VAS must be transparent in order to ensure trust of users and them recommending DAMA to friends

| 4
| Compatibility
| The game must be compatible with the primary compute platform and app distribution channel of the target demographic
